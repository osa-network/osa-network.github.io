## About Orion Systems Analysis

Orion Systems Analysis (OSA) is a speculative design and systems interpretation studio.

We explore the architecture of belief, infrastructure, narrative, and collapse.  
Our materials are presented as artifactsâ€”signals from overlapping realities.  
We offer no guarantees, only models. We do not predict the future. We model the terrain between futures.
